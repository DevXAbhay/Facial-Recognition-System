# Facial-Recognition-System
I am developing a facial recognition system that leverages cloud technology to provide scalable and secure facial data processing. The system captures images through an application, uploads them to the cloud, and uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and match faces. This cloud-based approach ensures high performance and availability, making it ideal for applications like security, user authentication, and personalized experiences. The app I am working on will integrate this system, allowing users to access facial recognition features seamlessly while ensuring data privacy and compliance with security standards.
